## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot through this project. This project was harder than I expected especially the navbar. I couldn't find a way to make it and ended up using online navbar generator. This was a great project for practising CSS grid.

```css
main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 20rem 21% 30% 30%;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  row-gap: 3rem;
  padding: 0 2%;
}
```
